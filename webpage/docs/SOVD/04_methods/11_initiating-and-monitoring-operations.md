# Initiating and Monitoring Operations in SOVD

The initiation and monitoring of operations are pivotal components of Service-Oriented Vehicle Diagnostics (SOVD), enabling dynamic interaction with vehicle systems. These operations include executing specific diagnostic routines, controlling actuators, or performing software updates, ensuring precise control and comprehensive monitoring in various scenarios.

## 1. **Overview of Operations in SOVD**

Operations in SOVD refer to actions performed on vehicle components, systems, or software. These actions include initiating specific functions, controlling actuators, or monitoring operational states. SOVD employs modern IT standards and a RESTful API for seamless execution and tracking.

### 1.1 **Core Features**
- **Standardized API**: Simplifies operation requests and responses.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks the progress and results of operations.
- **Multi-Mode Execution**: Supports both synchronous and asynchronous modes.

## 2. **Methodologies for Operations**

SOVD provides a robust framework for initiating and monitoring operations, leveraging RESTful principles and modern web technologies.

### 2.1 **Listing Available Operations**
   - Each component exposes its available operations through a dedicated endpoint.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     GET {base_uri}/components/engine/operations
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "items": [
         {
           "id": "highBeamControl",
           "name": "High Beam Control",
           "requires_lock": true
         },
         {
           "id": "fuelInjectorTest",
           "name": "Fuel Injector Test",
           "requires_lock": false
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

### 2.2 **Initiating Operations**
   - Operations can be started by sending a request to the operation's endpoint.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     POST {base_uri}/components/engine/operations/fuelInjectorTest
     {
       "parameters": {
         "duration": 5000,
         "pressureLevel": "medium"
       }
     }
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "execution_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
       "status": "in-progress"
     }
     ```

### 2.3 **Monitoring Operation Status**
   - Once initiated, the operation's progress and status can be monitored.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     GET {base_uri}/components/engine/operations/fuelInjectorTest/status
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "execution_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
       "status": "completed",
       "result": {
         "success": true,
         "details": "Injector test passed."
       }
     }
     ```

### 2.4 **Adjusting and Terminating Operations**
   - Operations can be modified or terminated based on their state and requirements.
   - **Adjust**:
     ```http
     PUT {base_uri}/components/engine/operations/fuelInjectorTest
     {
       "parameters": {
         "duration": 10000
       }
     }
     ```
   - **Terminate**:
     ```http
     DELETE {base_uri}/components/engine/operations/fuelInjectorTest
     ```

## 3. **Advanced Features**

### 3.1 **Locking Mechanism**
   - Prevents simultaneous access to critical resources by multiple clients.
   - **Example**:
     - Acquire Lock:
       ```http
       POST {base_uri}/components/engine/locks
       {
         "resource": "fuelInjectorTest",
         "lock_expiration": 3600
       }
       ```
       **Response**:
       ```json
       {
         "lock_id": "460AB8A5-5971-4693-8626-6287960050AF"
       }
       ```

### 3.2 **Target Modes**
   - Controls the state of entities before initiating operations.
   - **Retrieve Supported Modes**:
     ```http
     GET {base_uri}/components/engine/modes
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "modes": ["standby", "diagnostic", "operational"]
     }
     ```
   - **Set Mode**:
     ```http
     POST {base_uri}/components/engine/modes
     {
       "mode": "diagnostic"
     }
     ```

### 3.3 **Concurrent Execution**
   - Enables parallel execution of operations where applicable, increasing efficiency.
   - Managed through multi-client support and resource isolation.
