# Trigger-Based Data Access in SOVD

Trigger-based data access is a powerful feature of Service-Oriented Vehicle Diagnostics (SOVD) that enables real-time and event-driven retrieval of diagnostic information. This approach improves efficiency by collecting data only when specific conditions or triggers occur, reducing resource usage and enhancing responsiveness in dynamic diagnostic environments.

## 1. **Overview of Trigger-Based Data Access**

Trigger-based data access provides a mechanism to fetch or stream diagnostic data when predefined events or conditions are met. Unlike traditional polling methods, which continuously request data, this approach relies on event triggers, ensuring timely and resource-efficient diagnostics.

### 1.1 **Core Features**
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Initiates data collection based on specific triggers.
- **Dynamic Conditions**: Adapts to changing diagnostic requirements.
- **Enhanced Efficiency**: Reduces unnecessary data transmission and computational overhead.

## 2. **Methodologies for Trigger-Based Data Access**

SOVD provides a comprehensive framework to configure and manage trigger-based data access.

### 2.1 **Defining Triggers**
   - Triggers define the conditions under which data is accessed.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     POST {base_uri}/components/engine/triggers
     {
       "trigger_type": "threshold",
       "parameter": "engineTemperature",
       "threshold_value": 95,
       "operator": "greater_than"
     }
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "trigger_id": "7c9e6679-7425-40de-944b-e07fc1f90ae7",
       "status": "active"
     }
     ```

### 2.2 **Configuring Trigger-Based Data Access**
   - Triggers can be associated with specific data categories or components.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     PUT {base_uri}/components/engine/data/trigger-config
     {
       "trigger_id": "7c9e6679-7425-40de-944b-e07fc1f90ae7",
       "data_points": ["engineTemperature", "coolantLevel"]
     }
     ```

### 2.3 **Data Retrieval on Trigger**
   - Once a trigger condition is met, the specified data is automatically retrieved or pushed.
   - **Example of Event-Driven Push**:
     - **Request**:
       ```http
       GET {base_uri}/components/engine/data
       ```
     - **Response**:
       ```json
       {
         "event": "threshold_exceeded",
         "data": {
           "engineTemperature": 98,
           "coolantLevel": 30
         },
         "timestamp": "2025-01-19T12:34:56Z"
       }
       ```

### 2.4 **Managing Triggers**
   - **View All Triggers**:
     ```http
     GET {base_uri}/components/engine/triggers
     ```
   - **Disable or Remove a Trigger**:
     ```http
     DELETE {base_uri}/components/engine/triggers/7c9e6679-7425-40de-944b-e07fc1f90ae7
     ```

## 3. **Advanced Features**

### 3.1 **Trigger Types**
   - **Threshold Triggers**: Activated when a parameter exceeds or drops below a specified value.
   - **Event-Based Triggers**: Respond to specific events, such as fault occurrence.
   - **Time-Based Triggers**: Activate data retrieval at predefined intervals.

### 3.2 **Aggregated Trigger Responses**
   - Collects data from multiple parameters or components simultaneously.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     GET {base_uri}/components/data?trigger_id=aggregate_status_check
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "trigger_id": "aggregate_status_check",
       "data": {
         "engineTemperature": 97,
         "oilPressure": 60,
         "batteryVoltage": 12.4
       }
     }
     ```

### 3.3 **Trigger Persistence**
   - Triggers can be configured to persist across diagnostic sessions or reset after execution.

### 3.4 **Real-Time Streaming**
   - Supports periodic streaming of data for continuous monitoring.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     GET {base_uri}/components/engine/data-stream
     ```
     **Response** (Streamed):
     ```json
     {
       "timestamp": "2025-01-19T12:35:00Z",
       "engineTemperature": 96,
       "coolantLevel": 35
     }
     ```

## 4. **Use Cases for Trigger-Based Data Access**

### 4.1 **Real-Time Diagnostics**
   - Monitor critical parameters like engine temperature during high-performance operations.
   - **Example**: Activate a trigger to monitor overheating and prevent damage.

### 4.2 **Event-Driven Fault Analysis**
   - Automatically collect relevant data when a fault occurs.
   - **Example**: Capture environmental data upon a diagnostic trouble code (DTC) activation.

### 4.3 **Predictive Maintenance**
   - Proactively identify maintenance needs based on parameter thresholds.
   - **Example**: Monitor oil pressure drops and coolant levels for early warnings.

### 4.4 **Remote Monitoring**
   - Enable remote centers to access and act on trigger-initiated data.
   - **Example**: Remote assistance for long-haul vehicles based on critical parameter alerts.
