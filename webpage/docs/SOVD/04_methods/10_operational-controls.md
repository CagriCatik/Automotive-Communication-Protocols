# Operational Controls in SOVD

Operational controls in Service-Oriented Vehicle Diagnostics (SOVD) enable precise management of vehicle systems, components, and software. These controls allow technicians, developers, and diagnostic tools to interact with operational parameters, initiate or halt actions, and monitor system states, providing a flexible and comprehensive diagnostic and maintenance framework.

## 1. **Overview of Operational Controls in SOVD**

Operational controls encompass the initiation, monitoring, and termination of vehicle operations. These operations can range from routine actuator tests to software configuration changes. SOVD leverages a standardized API to simplify these interactions while maintaining flexibility and efficiency.

### 1.1 **Core Features**
- **Standardized Operations**: Uniform APIs for various operational tasks.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks progress and results of operations dynamically.
- **Comprehensive Control**: Covers component-level, system-level, and software-level operations.

## 2. **Methodologies for Operational Controls**

SOVD provides structured methodologies to initiate, adjust, and manage operational controls dynamically through its RESTful APIs.

### 2.1 **Listing Available Controls**
   - Retrieve a list of all available operational controls for a specific component.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     GET {base_uri}/components/engine/operations
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "items": [
         {
           "id": "coolingFanControl",
           "name": "Cooling Fan Control",
           "requires_lock": false
         },
         {
           "id": "fuelInjectorTest",
           "name": "Fuel Injector Test",
           "requires_lock": true
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

### 2.2 **Initiating an Operation**
   - Start an operation by specifying parameters.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     POST {base_uri}/components/engine/operations/coolingFanControl
     {
       "parameters": {
         "speed": "medium",
         "duration": 3000
       }
     }
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "execution_id": "abc12345-6789-0def-1122-334455667788",
       "status": "in-progress"
     }
     ```

### 2.3 **Monitoring Operational Status**
   - Track the progress or result of an ongoing operation.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     GET {base_uri}/components/engine/operations/coolingFanControl/status
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "execution_id": "abc12345-6789-0def-1122-334455667788",
       "status": "completed",
       "result": {
         "success": true,
         "details": "Cooling fan operated at medium speed for 3000 ms."
       }
     }
     ```

### 2.4 **Adjusting and Terminating Operations**
   - Modify parameters of an ongoing operation or terminate it.
   - **Adjust Operation**:
     ```http
     PUT {base_uri}/components/engine/operations/coolingFanControl
     {
       "parameters": {
         "speed": "high"
       }
     }
     ```
   - **Terminate Operation**:
     ```http
     DELETE {base_uri}/components/engine/operations/coolingFanControl
     ```

## 3. **Advanced Features**

### 3.1 **Target Modes**
   - Control the operating mode of a component or system to enable specific functionalities.
   - **Retrieve Supported Modes**:
     ```http
     GET {base_uri}/components/engine/modes
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "modes": ["diagnostic", "operational", "standby"]
     }
     ```
   - **Set Mode**:
     ```http
     POST {base_uri}/components/engine/modes
     {
       "mode": "diagnostic"
     }
     ```

### 3.2 **Locking Mechanism**
   - Ensures exclusive access to resources during critical operations to prevent conflicts.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     POST {base_uri}/components/engine/locks
     {
       "resource": "fuelInjectorTest",
       "lock_expiration": 3600
     }
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "lock_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
     }
     ```

### 3.3 **Concurrent Operations**
   - Supports simultaneous execution of operations on different components while ensuring resource isolation.

### 3.4 **Event-Based Operations**
   - Trigger operations dynamically based on predefined events or conditions.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     POST {base_uri}/components/engine/triggers
     {
       "trigger_type": "fault_event",
       "fault_code": "P123401",
       "action": "initiate",
       "operation": "coolingFanControl"
