## 2. **Methodologies for Querying Faults**

SOVD allows detailed fault queries based on various criteria, ensuring precise and efficient diagnostics.

### 2.1 **Basic Fault Retrieval**
   - Retrieve a list of all faults associated with a component.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     GET {base_uri}/components/engine/faults
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "items": [
         {
           "code": "P123401",
           "fault_name": "O2 Sensor – Circuit Open",
           "severity": 2,
           "status": {
             "aggregatedStatus": "active"
           }
         },
         {
           "code": "P098765",
           "fault_name": "Catalytic Converter Efficiency Low",
           "severity": 3,
           "status": {
             "aggregatedStatus": "pending"
           }
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

### 2.2 **Filtering Faults by Status**
   - Retrieve faults based on specific statuses such as `active`, `pending`, or `confirmed`.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     GET {base_uri}/components/engine/faults?status[aggregatedStatus]=active
     ```

### 2.3 **Retrieving Fault Details**
   - Obtain detailed information about a specific fault, including environmental and context data.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     GET {base_uri}/components/engine/faults/P123401
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "code": "P123401",
       "fault_name": "O2 Sensor – Circuit Open",
       "severity": 2,
       "environment_data": {
         "temperature": "85°C",
         "voltage": "12.6V"
       }
     }
     ```

### 2.4 **Aggregated Fault Queries**
   - Retrieve summaries of multiple faults for comprehensive analysis.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     GET {base_uri}/components/engine/faults?aggregate=true
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "summary": {
         "total_faults": 5,
         "critical_faults": 1,
         "pending_faults": 3
       }
     }
     ```

## 3. **Methodologies for Deleting Faults**

SOVD provides flexible methods to delete faults, ensuring that vehicle systems are promptly updated after corrective actions.

### 3.1 **Deleting All Faults**
   - Clear all faults from a component, typically after repairs or resets.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     DELETE {base_uri}/components/engine/faults
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "status": "success",
       "message": "All faults cleared."
     }
     ```

### 3.2 **Deleting Specific Faults**
   - Remove a specific fault based on its unique code.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     DELETE {base_uri}/components/engine/faults/P123401
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "status": "success",
       "message": "Fault P123401 cleared."
     }
     ```

### 3.3 **Conditional Fault Deletion**
   - Remove faults based on criteria like severity or status.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     DELETE {base_uri}/components/engine/faults?status[aggregatedStatus]=pending
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "status": "success",
       "message": "Pending faults cleared."
     }
     ```

## 4. **Advanced Features**

### 4.1 **Fault Metadata**
   - Includes severity, aggregated status, and associated environment data.
   - Example metadata in a query response:
     ```json
     {
       "code": "P123401",
       "fault_name": "O2 Sensor – Circuit Open",
       "severity": 2,
       "status": "active"
     }
     ```

### 4.2 **Multi-Client Support**
   - Fault operations support simultaneous access and management by multiple clients, ensuring collaboration across teams.

### 4.3 **Event-Driven Updates**
