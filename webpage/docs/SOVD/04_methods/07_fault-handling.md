# Fault Handling in SOVD

Fault handling is a core functionality of Service-Oriented Vehicle Diagnostics (SOVD), ensuring the efficient detection, management, and resolution of diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs). It extends the capabilities of traditional systems by integrating modern IT standards and enabling advanced fault management scenarios in dynamic and complex vehicle architectures.

## 1. **Overview of Fault Handling in SOVD**

Fault handling in SOVD includes discovering, managing, and resolving faults across electronic control units (ECUs) and high-performance computers (HPCs). It employs a unified API for accessing fault information, categorizing fault data, and facilitating operations such as fault deletion and status updates.

### 1.1 **Key Concepts**
- **Fault Resources**: Represent individual or grouped faults in the system.
- **Fault Metadata**: Includes fault codes, severity levels, status, and associated environment data.
- **Dynamic Fault Management**: Supports on-demand queries and handling without predefined diagnostic description files.

## 2. **Methods for Fault Handling**

SOVD provides robust methods for managing faults through standardized API endpoints. These methods allow developers and testers to interact with fault data effectively:

### 2.1 **Fault Querying**
   - **Retrieve Fault Information**: Access a list of all faults associated with a component.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     GET {base_uri}/components/engine/faults
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "items": [
         {
           "code": "P123401",
           "fault_name": "O2 Sensor – Circuit Open",
           "severity": 2,
           "status": {
             "aggregatedStatus": "active"
           }
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

### 2.2 **Fault Status Filtering**
   - Enables targeted queries based on fault statuses such as `active`, `pending`, or `confirmed`.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     GET {base_uri}/components/engine/faults?status[aggregatedStatus]=active
     ```

### 2.3 **Fault Details Retrieval**
   - Provides detailed environmental data and fault-specific metadata.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     GET {base_uri}/components/engine/faults/P123401
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "code": "P123401",
       "fault_name": "O2 Sensor – Circuit Open",
       "severity": 2,
       "environment_data": {
         "temperature": "85°C",
         "voltage": "12.6V"
       }
     }
     ```

### 2.4 **Fault Deletion**
   - Allows clearing individual or all faults from a component.
   - **Examples**:
     - **Clear all faults**:
       ```http
       DELETE {base_uri}/components/engine/faults
       ```
     - **Clear a specific fault**:
       ```http
       DELETE {base_uri}/components/engine/faults/P123401
       ```

### 2.5 **Environment Data Association**
   - Links faults to additional context, such as operating conditions or stack traces.
   - **Key Advantage**: Simplifies root cause analysis by integrating real-time and historical data.

## 3. **Advanced Fault Handling Features**

### 3.1 **Categorization by Severity**
   - Faults are ranked based on their impact, with severity levels indicating urgency.
   - Examples:
     - **Severity 1**: Critical (e.g., brake failure).
     - **Severity 2**: High (e.g., emission system malfunction).
     - **Severity 3**: Informational (e.g., routine maintenance).

### 3.2 **Fault Aggregation**
   - Combines related faults into comprehensive summaries for efficient troubleshooting.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     GET {base_uri}/components/engine/faults?aggregate=true
     ```

### 3.3 **Locking Mechanism**
   - Ensures exclusive fault operations to prevent conflicts in multi-client scenarios.
   - **Example**:
     - Lock a fault resource:
       ```http
       POST {base_uri}/components/engine/locks
       {
         "resource": "faults",
         "lock_expiration": 3600
       }
       ```

### 3.4 **Fault Memory Management**
   - Enables the creation of fault-specific memory blocks for streamlined data retrieval and management.
