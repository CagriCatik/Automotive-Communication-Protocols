# Accessing Environment Data in SOVD

Accessing environment data is a critical capability of Service-Oriented Vehicle Diagnostics (SOVD), providing essential context to diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) and operational states. This feature allows technicians and diagnostic tools to retrieve supplementary data, such as sensor readings or operating conditions, that help identify root causes and implement effective solutions.

## 2. **Methodologies for Accessing Environment Data**

SOVD employs RESTful APIs to facilitate efficient access to environment data. These methods support flexible queries and structured responses, ensuring compatibility across diagnostic tools.

### 2.1 **Querying Environment Data**
   - Retrieve environment data associated with a specific fault or system parameter.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     GET {base_uri}/components/engine/faults/P123401/environment
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "code": "P123401",
       "fault_name": "O2 Sensor – Circuit Open",
       "environment_data": {
         "temperature": "85°C",
         "voltage": "12.6V",
         "speed": "60 km/h",
         "load": "75%"
       }
     }
     ```

### 2.2 **Filtering Environment Data**
   - Query specific environment parameters using filters.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     GET {base_uri}/components/engine/faults/P123401/environment?parameters=temperature,voltage
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "environment_data": {
         "temperature": "85°C",
         "voltage": "12.6V"
       }
     }
     ```

### 2.3 **Batch Environment Data Retrieval**
   - Retrieve environment data for multiple faults or parameters in a single request.

     GET {base_uri}/components/engine/environment?faults=P123401,P098765
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "items": [
         {
           "code": "P123401",
           "environment_data": {
             "temperature": "85°C",
             "voltage": "12.6V"
           }
         },
         {
           "code": "P098765",
           "environment_data": {
             "temperature": "90°C",
             "voltage": "11.8V"
           }
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

### 2.4 **Real-Time Streaming of Environment Data**
   - Supports periodic or trigger-based streaming for continuous monitoring.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     GET {base_uri}/components/engine/environment-stream
     ```
     **Response** (Streamed):
     ```json
     {
       "timestamp": "2025-01-19T14:32:56Z",
       "environment_data": {
         "temperature": "86°C",
         "voltage": "12.5V",
         "load": "80%"
       }
     }
     ```

## 3. **Advanced Features**

### 3.1 **Environment Data Aggregation**
   - Combines multiple data points into a unified response for comprehensive analysis.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     GET {base_uri}/components/engine/environment?aggregate=true
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "aggregated_environment_data": {
         "average_temperature": "85°C",
         "average_voltage": "12.4V"
       }
     }
     ```

### 3.2 **Event-Based Retrieval**
   - Automatically collects environment data when a trigger condition is met.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     POST {base_uri}/components/engine/triggers
     {
       "trigger_type": "fault_event",
       "fault_code": "P123401",
       "action": "retrieve_environment"
     }
     ```

### 3.3 **Historical Data Access**
