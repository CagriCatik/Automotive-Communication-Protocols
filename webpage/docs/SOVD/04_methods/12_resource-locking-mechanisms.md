# Resource Locking Mechanisms in SOVD

Resource locking mechanisms are critical in Service-Oriented Vehicle Diagnostics (SOVD) to ensure exclusive access to vehicle resources during operations. This prevents conflicts, maintains data integrity, and facilitates secure multi-client diagnostic and maintenance processes in modern vehicle systems.

## 1. **Overview of Resource Locking in SOVD**

Resource locking enables a client to claim exclusive access to a specific resource, such as an actuator or a diagnostic operation. This mechanism is particularly important in multi-client environments where simultaneous access could lead to resource conflicts or inconsistent states.

### 1.1 **Core Features**
- **Exclusive Access**: Prevents conflicts by granting a single client access to a resource.
- **Dynamic Management**: Locks can be created, monitored, renewed, or released as needed.
- **Expiration Mechanism**: Automatically releases locks after a specified duration to avoid resource deadlocks.

---

## 2. **Methodologies for Resource Locking**

SOVD uses a standardized API to handle resource locking dynamically, ensuring that critical operations remain isolated and secure.

### 2.1 **Creating a Lock**
   - A lock is established for a resource to ensure exclusive access.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     POST {base_uri}/components/engine/locks
     {
       "resource": "fuelInjectorTest",
       "lock_expiration": 3600
     }
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "lock_id": "460AB8A5-5971-4693-8626-6287960050AF",
       "status": "locked",
       "expires_in": 3600
     }
     ```

### 2.2 **Querying Lock Status**
   - Retrieve the status of a lock to determine if a resource is currently locked and by whom.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     GET {base_uri}/components/engine/locks/460AB8A5-5971-4693-8626-6287960050AF
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "lock_id": "460AB8A5-5971-4693-8626-6287960050AF",
       "status": "active",
       "resource": "fuelInjectorTest",
       "owner": "client123",
       "expires_in": 1800
     }
     ```

### 2.3 **Renewing a Lock**
   - Extend the expiration time of an existing lock to maintain resource exclusivity.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     PUT {base_uri}/components/engine/locks/460AB8A5-5971-4693-8626-6287960050AF
     {
       "lock_expiration": 3600
     }
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "lock_id": "460AB8A5-5971-4693-8626-6287960050AF",
       "status": "renewed",
       "expires_in": 3600
     }
     ```

### 2.4 **Releasing a Lock**
   - Explicitly release a lock when it is no longer required, freeing the resource for other clients.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     DELETE {base_uri}/components/engine/locks/460AB8A5-5971-4693-8626-6287960050AF
     ```
     **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "status": "released",
       "lock_id": "460AB8A5-5971-4693-8626-6287960050AF"
     }
     ```

## 3. **Advanced Features**

### 3.1 **Lock Expiration**
   - Locks automatically expire after the defined duration to prevent resource blocking.
   - **Configuration**:
     ```json
     {
       "lock_expiration": 3600
     }
     ```
   - Clients must renew locks before expiration if the resource is still in use.

### 3.2 **Conflict Management**
   - When a locked resource is accessed by another client, an HTTP `409 Conflict` response is returned.
   - **Example Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "error": "resource_locked",
       "message": "Resource is currently locked by another client."
     }
     ```

### 3.3 **Lock Ownership**
   - Identifies the client that owns a specific lock, enhancing traceability and management.
   - Example response when querying lock status:
     ```json
     {
       "owner": "client123",
       "resource": "fuelInjectorTest",
       "expires_in": 1800
     }
     ```

### 3.4 **Lock Priority and Override**
   - Optional configurations for overriding locks with priority levels for critical operations.
   - Example request to override a lock:
     ```http
     POST {base_uri}/components/engine/locks/override
     {
       "resource": "fuelInjectorTest",
       "priority": "high"
     }
     ```

## 4. **Use Cases for Resource Locking**

### 4.1 **Actuator Testing**
   - Lock an actuator to ensure exclusive control during tests.
   - Example: Secure exclusive access to a cooling fan while running diagnostics.

### 4.2 **Software Updates**
   - Prevent simultaneous access to software components during critical update processes.
   - Example: Lock a software module during firmware installation.

### 4.3 **Multi-Client Scenarios**
   - Avoid conflicts in environments where multiple clients (e.g., workshop technicians and remote support centers) access the same resources.

### 4.4 **Safety-Critical Operations**
   - Ensure secure execution of operations that impact vehicle safety, such as disabling high-voltage systems during maintenance.
