# Automotive Communication Protocols

This repository serves as a comprehensive knowledge base for **Automotive Communication Protocols**. It provides structured information on widely-used protocols in the automotive industry, organized into the following categories:

- **CAN** (Controller Area Network)
- **LIN** (Local Interconnect Network)
- **FlexRay**
- **ETHERNET**
- **DoIP** (Diagnostics over IP)
- **SOME/IP** (Scalable service-Oriented Middleware over IP)
- **XCP** (Universal Measurement and Calibration Protocol)

## About the Project

The content in this repository is the foundation of a Docusaurus-powered website that offers in-depth documentation, tutorials, and examples for these protocols. The website aims to provide clear, concise, and organized information for developers, engineers, and anyone interested in automotive communication standards.

### Features

- **Detailed Protocol Documentation:** Understand the fundamentals, use cases, and technical details of each protocol.
- **Easy Navigation:** Quickly access information with the help of a Docusaurus-generated webpage.
- **Open Contribution:** Contributions are welcome to improve and expand the content.

### Website

The documentation is hosted and built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Check out the live site here: [Automotive Communication Protocols Documentation](#) (link to be updated once deployed).

## Folder Structure

Each folder represents a specific communication protocol and contains related documentation, code samples, and additional resources.
